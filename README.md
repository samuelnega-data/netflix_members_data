# Netflix Members Data Analysis

```sql
Tools being used for the project: SQL 
```

## Overview
In this project, I will analyze the Netflix dataset to gain deeper insights into Netflix users and identify key features that contribute to user loyalty on the platform.

## Data exploration
After exploring the dataset, I found that no cleaning or transformation is necessary, as it is well-structured and ready for analysis. Here are some key observations specifically related to the dataset.
- Churn Status: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
- Support Queries would indicate the number of times each customer queried for help
- Promotional Offers: 1 = Yes, 0 = No
- Numbers of Profiles Created: I am assuming this is the number of people that are under the users profile
